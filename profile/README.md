## What is Eco-Flow?

Eco-Flow is a UCL based research initiative to develop agri-ecology specific modern, reproducible and scalable data pipelines.

Eco-Flow wants to do more than just build pipelines, we want to cultivate a healthy community of people who share similar research within agri-ecology who can help support each other with their research and analysis. 

This community is centered around the pipelines developed by the Eco-Flow team. The pipelines developed will be requested by the community.

**If you would like to join the community then please email `ecoflowucl [at] gmail.com`.**

Or start a community discussion about a potential pipeline by creating a new issue on [Eco-Flow/pipeline-discussions](https://github.com/Eco-Flow/pipeline-discussions/issues).

## Where can I found out more?

All the Eco-Flow information can be found on our website: [https://eco-flow.github.io](https://eco-flow.github.io/).

## What is special about our Pipelines?

We intend to develop novel, gold standard Nextflow pipelines for the agri-ecology field. These pipelines will fully adhere to the nf-core community [guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/guidelines), have complete unit testing with [nf-test](https://www.nf-test.com/) and use containerised environments published to our quay.io space: [quay.io/user/ecoflowucl](https://quay.io/user/ecoflowucl/). 

The intention if for all our pipelines to be deployable in any environment (local, on-prem HPC or cloud) utilising either [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker/) or [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/introduction.html#why-use-singularityce) for containerisation. 

At Eco-Flow we want to help make deploying large-scale bioinformatics pipelines as easy for you as possible which is why everything we produce is public. This includes the configuration files for specific on-premise HPCs. If you want to see if we have already configured Nextflow for you HPC then check out [Eco-Flow/configs](https://github.com/Eco-Flow/configs).

## Published Pipelines

* [Eco-Flow/synteny](https://github.com/Eco-Flow/synteny) - A pipeline that compares gene synteny between chromosome level genome assemblies.
